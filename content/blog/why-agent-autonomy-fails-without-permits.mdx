## Autonomy needs explicit scope

Agent autonomy breaks when execution rights are implicit. If an agent can call every protocol and move every asset, a single bad decision can become a full account compromise.

Permits solve this by expressing exactly what is allowed, for how long, and under what conditions. They convert natural language intent into deterministic machine constraints.

<Callout title="Why this matters">
Permits do not just improve security. They define execution boundaries that make automated systems testable and auditable.
</Callout>

## What a useful permit must include

A practical permit should define principal, action, resource, and constraint set. Constraints should include value limits, protocol allowlists, and expiry.

Without these fields, incident response depends on emergency revocation and luck. With them, the blast radius is bounded before execution starts.

```json
{
  "principal": "agent:rebalance-bot",
  "actions": ["swap"],
  "protocols": ["jupiter"],
  "max_notional_usd": 25000,
  "expires_at": "2026-02-20T18:00:00Z"
}
```

## Permits are the control plane

Monitoring and audits are valuable, but they are post-event tools. Permits are pre-event controls that make unsafe execution unrepresentable.

For autonomous finance, permits are not optional compliance features. They are the minimum structure that makes autonomy survivable.
