title: "V1 scope: Solana + Jupiter + Solend and why"
date: 2026-02-18
description: Constrained surface area is a security strategy. V1 focuses on one chain and two core protocol rails.

## Why this scope is deliberate

V1 should maximize learning per integration while minimizing unknown interactions. Solana provides low-latency execution and mature tooling for deterministic checks.

Jupiter and Solend cover core workflows for routing and lending without expanding into broad, unbounded protocol exposure.

## Security upside of narrower integrations

A tighter integration set enables stronger simulation coverage, clearer allowlists, and faster incident triage. Every additional protocol adds policy complexity and threat surface.

Scope discipline is not a growth constraint. It is how you ship a system that users can trust before scaling outward.

```yaml
v1_scope:
  chain: solana
  protocols:
    - jupiter
    - solend
  controls:
    - slippage_limits
    - protocol_allowlists
    - permit_expiry
    - receipt_signing
```

<Callout title="After V1">
Each new integration should pass the same policy and observability bar before it is added to the allowed execution surface.
</Callout>

## What changes after V1

After invariants and receipts are stable, the roadmap can add integrations in controlled phases. This sequence keeps security architecture ahead of distribution instead of trailing behind it.
